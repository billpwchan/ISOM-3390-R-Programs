### 2. Hello World!
Here's an R code chunk that prints the text "Hello world!"
```{r print}
# language chunkName , option(s)
print("Hello world!")
```

(a) Create **3** code chunks below: 
  (1) name them `printYourName1`, `printYourName2`, `printYourName3`;
  (2) add option `eval=FALSE`, `echo=FALSE` and `collapse=TRUE` respectively;
  (3) and print YourName1, YourName2, YourName3 in the chunks respectively

```{r printYourName1, eval=FALSE}
print("ChanPokWah1")
```
```{r printYourName2, echo=FALSE}
print("ChanPokWah2")
